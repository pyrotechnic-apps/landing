                VentusAV is a revolutionary new platform in the Private
                Aviation Charter Market that uses cutting-edge technology to
                bypass the traditional broker and connect the Customer and
                Operator directly.
              </p>

              <p>
                Ventus wanted a premium branded iPhone app and equivalent
                website that would be simple to use, taking the user right
                through from requesting a flight to the completed booking. In
                addition, they wanted a web portal to allow the operators to
                respond to the bespoke flight requests from customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Timescales formed a critical part of this project, in order
                that the app be delivered in good time for the Ventus team to
                take the app to an air show to attract investors.
