                        prototype app to take to an air show to attract investors.<br/>
                        We developed the app to a proof of concept stage, within tight deadlines and the VentusAV app is

                        Flatty helps residents, managers and their staff communicate effectively about repairs,
                        contacting the caretaker, sharing classified ads, local traffic news and of course, allocating
                        parking spaces.<br/>
                        We have now completed a successful six-month pilot with Flatty in a residential block, and we
                        are looking for more test opportunities and investment for further development.<br/>

                    The first question we are always asked is, ‘How much does an app cost?’ <br/>
                    The price will depend on the size, number of features and complexity of the app to be developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our projects can start from the initial design phase on one platform for £2-4K.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can then help you navigate through the different stages including prototyping, functional testing
                    and deployment up to a fully operational,
                    all bells n’ whistles high performing app on web and mobile platforms for £15-40K.
                </p>
                <p>The most effective route to market is to invest in developing an app for the iPhone and iPad first.
                    Once it is successful, many businesses will commission an equivalent Android App, to further open up
                    the market opportunities.
